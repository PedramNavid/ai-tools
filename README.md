# ai-tools
fun little ai tools i built to share with my friends

## gt-tools

some git tools that i find helpful for day-to-day life, powered by claude. 
the one i use most commonly is 'branch and commit'. stage some files, run the tool, and it'll create a new branch and commit based on the changes.

## pm

very simple project management tool for creating and updating tasks. can integreate easily with claude code as a replacement for the TodoWrite tool, so you can have persistent todos.
